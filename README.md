# Sports-Betting
Overview
This project represents a sports betting application created exclusively in C#. The application features a user-friendly menu that allows users to view available matches, check the best-rated matches, generate PDFs with match details, and place bets. When users click on "Pariaza!" a new page opens, displaying their current account balance, the option to add funds, and the ability to place a bet on a specific match.
